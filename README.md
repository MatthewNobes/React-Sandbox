#Welcome to my React sandbox

This is a playground for everything I want to test in React and possible just general JavaScript work.

To improve documentation for this I will eventually setup JSDocs to better detail this work.

##Key Scripts
A number of different scripts have been setup for this program. A full list of these can be found in the package.json. I have also incldued a few of the key ones here:
* The start script is used to start the program using the stanard NPM/React formatting.
```bash
npm run start
```
* The generate docs script is used to regenerate the JSDocs documentation and should be executed when a change has been made it its setup within any file. 
```bash
npm run generate-docs
```

##Usage Notice 

If you want to use any of the code in your own project, either commercial or personal, feel free. 

The main purpose of this repo is to provide myself with reference on these pieces so I doubt others will make use of it.
